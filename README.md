This is a fork of [http://github.com/darothen/pyrcel](), a package that we used as a point of reference for experimental computational research during the time I spent doing mentored graduate research with [Dr. Peter Blossey](https://atmos.washington.edu/~bloss/) and [Dr. Robert Wood](https://faculty.washington.edu/robwood2/wordpress/) of University of Washington's [Department of Atmospheric Sciences](https://atmos.uw.edu/).
